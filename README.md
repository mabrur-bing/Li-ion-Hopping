# Lithium Super Ion Conductor Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the investigation of thermal and kinetic properties of 3D lattice Coulomb gases modeled after Lithium super ion conductors. Utilizing parallel tempering and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, we explore the relationship between frustration and ionic conductivity.

## Overview

The notebook processes CIF files of super ion conductor materials with `pymatgen`, constructs lattice Coulomb gas models, calculates Coulomb energies via Ewald sums, and assesses ionic conductivity and thermal properties such as heat capacity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Dependencies include:
- pymatgen
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
